## Building

* Run `grunt`

## TODO

* **PRIORITY:** Auto updater, this should be the first thing towards a release. The current plan is to use GitHub releases with gh-pages or raw-github as the update server.
* Use browserify or webpack: We tried using it but with both, its showing weird errors related to "makeNodePromisified", etc
